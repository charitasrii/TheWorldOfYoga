        <header> <h1> INTERNATIONAL DAY OF YOGA </h1><br>
           <P><h3> The International Day of Yoga has been celebrated annually on 21 June since 2015, following its inception in the United Nations General Assembly in 2014. Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice which originated in India. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, in his UN address suggested the date of 21 June, as it is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and shares a special significance in many parts of the world. </h3></P><br>
           <P><h3> The idea of an International Day of Yoga was first proposed by the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), on 27 September 2014.<br><br>
                He stated:<br>
                Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help in well being. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day.<br><br>
                — Narendra Modi, UN General Assembly<br><br>
            Following this initial proposal, the UNGA held informal consultations on the draft resolution, entitled "International Day of Yoga", on 14 October 2014. The consultations were convened by the delegation of India. In 2015 Reserve Bank of India issued a 10 rupees commemorative coin to mark the International Day of Yoga. In April 2017, UN Postal Administration (UNPA) issued 10 stamps on Asanas on a single sheet to mark International Day of Yoga </h3></P>

            <h3>The first International Day of Yoga was observed around the world on 21 June 2015. The Ministry of AYUSH made the necessary arrangements in India. 35,985 people, including PM Modi and dignitaries from 84 nations, performed 21 asanas (yoga postures) for 35 minutes at Rajpath in New Delhi, becoming the largest yoga class ever held, and with the largest number—84—of participating nations. Similar days have been held in cities in India and around the world each year since then.</h3>

            <h3>An Associated Press report in 2015 noted that the first "International Yoga Day"involved "millions of yoga enthusiasts" 

                who "stretched and twisted", as well as Modi and members of his cabinet. It stated that the main road in Delhi had 
                
                become an exercise area for the occasion, and reported that while Modi was speaking of "peace and harmony", some 
                
                people in India thought the promotion of yoga was a partisan Hindu operation. It reported that a sequence of Surya 
                
                Namaskar (sun salutations) was dropped because Muslims objected to the implication that the sun was the Hindu god 
                
                of the sun, Surya; the chanting of the Hindu sacred syllable "Om" was also dropped. Others considered that the money 
                
                spent on the event might have been better spent on cleaning Delhi's streets.<br><br>
                
                The Christian Science Monitor wrote in 2016 that the 2014 United Nations resolution had been "wildly popular"[24] but 
                
                noted that yoga had a "meditative component"[24] and had become known as not only a form of physical exercise but 
                
                also a mental and spiritual practice. It gave as evidence the 2015 sermon by Pope Francis cautioning Roman Catholics 
                
                about the idea that yoga could be a path to God; it noted, too, that Modi had replied to the charge that the Day was 
                
                intended to promote Hinduism with the words "Yoga is not about the other life. Therefore, it is not a religious 
                
                practice".<br><br>
                
                The Week stated in 2015 that the government of India's purpose in holding International Days of Yoga was to have yoga 
                
                recognised around the world as "India's cultural property", citing India's minister of yoga, Shripad Yesso Naik as stating 
                
                "We're trying to establish to the world that it's ours."The Week wrote that this was not likely to succeed, not least 
                
                because many types of yoga were already being practised in the Western world. The article noted that Christian 
                
                evangelicals agreed with the Indian government that yoga was "primarily a Hindu spiritual practice", but quoted the 
                
                scholar of religion Ann Gleig as saying that most Western yoga was markedly changed by being in the West, and was 
                
                devoid of religious content; the "ironically" agreeing views of strongly religious Hindus and Christians were "historically 
                
                flawed".<br><br>
